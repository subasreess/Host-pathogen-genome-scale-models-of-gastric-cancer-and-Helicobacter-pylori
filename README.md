Gastric cancer genome-scale metabolic models built using the transcriptomic data of the in-vitro infection on gastric cancer cell lines by Helicobacter pylori (0, 2, 6 hours post infection)
(I. Sharafutdinov et al.,Cell Insight,2022)

Eukaryotic reactive species reactions module integrated metabolic models of gastric cancer (model_hp0_rs, model_hp2_rs and model_hp6_rs)

Helicobacter pylori metabolic model updated with a few additional  reactions (THIELE  ET  AL.,J. BACTERIOL,2005)
